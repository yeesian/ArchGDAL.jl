Identify the driver that can open a raster file.

Validate the list of creation options that are handled by a drv.

This is a helper method primarily used by `create()` and `createcopy()` to
validate that the passed in list of creation options is compatible with the
`GDAL_DMD_CREATIONOPTIONLIST` metadata item defined by some drivers.

### Parameters
* `drv`     the handle of the driver with whom the lists of creation option
            must be validated
* `options` the list of creation options. An array of strings, whose last
            element is a `NULL` pointer

### Returns
`TRUE` if the list of creation options is compatible with the `create()` and
`createCopy()` method of the driver, `FALSE` otherwise.

### Additional Remarks
See also: `options(drv::Driver)`

If the `GDAL_DMD_CREATIONOPTIONLIST` metadata item is not defined, this
function will return `TRUE`. Otherwise it will check that the keys and values
in the list of creation options are compatible with the capabilities declared
by the `GDAL_DMD_CREATIONOPTIONLIST` metadata item. In case of incompatibility
a (non fatal) warning will be emited and `FALSE` will be returned.
