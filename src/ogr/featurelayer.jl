Set a new spatial filter for the layer, using the geom.

This method set the geometry to be used as a spatial filter when fetching

Currently this test may be inaccurately implemented, but it is guaranteed
that all features who's envelope (as returned by OGRGeometry::getEnvelope())
overlaps the envelope of the spatial filter will be returned. This can result
in more shapes being returned that should strictly be the case.

remains the responsibility of the caller, and may be safely destroyed.

### Parameters
* `layer`  handle to the layer on which to set the spatial filter.
* `geom`   handle to the geometry to use as a filtering region. NULL may be
           passed indicating that the current spatial filter should be cleared,
           but no new one instituted.

### Additional Remarks
For the time being the passed filter geometry should be in the same SRS as the
geometry field definition it corresponds to (as returned by
`GetLayerDefn()->OGRFeatureDefn::GetGeomFieldDefn(i)->GetSpatialRef()`).
In the future this may be generalized.

Set a new attribute query.

This method sets the attribute query string to be used when fetching features

The query string should be in the format of an SQL WHERE clause. For instance
`"population > 1000000 and population < 5000000"` where population is an
attribute in the layer. The query format is normally a restricted form of
SQL WHERE clause as described in the "WHERE" section of the OGR SQL tutorial.
In some cases (RDBMS backed drivers) the native capabilities of the database may
be used to interpret the WHERE clause in which case the capabilities will be
broader than those of OGR SQL.

Note that installing a query string will generally result in resetting the
current reading position (ala ResetReading()).

Only features matching the current spatial filter (set with SetSpatialFilter())

This method implements sequential access to the features of a layer. The

Features returned by `GetNextFeature()` may or may not be affected by concurrent

called, before reading again. Structural changes in layers (field addition,
deletion, ...) when a read is in progress may or may not be possible depending
on drivers. If a transaction is committed/aborted, the current sequential

Move read cursor to the `i`-th feature in the current resultset.

`GetNextFeature()` would have been the 4th feature to have been read if
sequential reading took place from the beginning of the layer, including
accounting for spatial and attribute filters.

other cases the default implementation which calls `ResetReading()` and then
calls `GetNextFeature()` `i` times is used. To determine if fast seeking is

in the result layer have attributes from both input and method layers. The

initialized to contain all fields in the input and method layers.

### Parameters
* `input`: the input layer. Should not be NULL.
* `method`: the method layer. Should not be NULL.
* `result`: the layer where the features resulting from the operation
    are inserted. Should not be NULL. See the note about the schema.

    reporting progress or NULL.
* `progressdata`: argument to be passed to pfnProgress. May be NULL.

an error code if there was an error or the execution was interrupted,

same name as a field in input and in method layer, then the attribute in the
result feature will get the value from the feature of the method layer.

* `input`: the input layer. Should not be NULL.
* `method`: the method layer. Should not be NULL.
* `result`: the layer where the features resulting from the operation
    are inserted. Should not be NULL. See the note about the schema.
* `papszOptions`: NULL terminated list of options (may be NULL).
* `pfnProgress`: a GDALProgressFunc() compatible callback function for
    reporting progress or NULL.
* `pProgressArg`: argument to be passed to pfnProgress. May be NULL.

### Returns
an error code if there was an error or the execution was interrupted,
OGRERR_NONE otherwise.

### Additional Remarks
If the schema of the result is set by user and contains fields that have the
same name as a field in input and in method layer, then the attribute in the
result feature will get the value from the feature of the method layer.

For best performance use the minimum amount of features in the method layer and
copy it into a memory layer. This method relies on GEOS support. Do not use
unless the GEOS support is compiled in. The recognized list of options is :

* `SKIP_FAILURES=YES/NO`. Set it to YES to go on, even when a feature could not
    be inserted or a GEOS call failed.
* `PROMOTE_TO_MULTI=YES/NO`. Set it to YES to convert Polygons into
    MultiPolygons, or LineStrings to MultiLineStrings.
* `INPUT_PREFIX=string`. Set a prefix for the field names that will be created
    from the fields of the input layer.
* `METHOD_PREFIX=string`. Set a prefix for the field names that will be created
    from the fields of the method layer.
