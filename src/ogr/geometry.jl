"""
Add a geometry directly to an existing geometry container.

Some subclasses of OGRGeometryCollection restrict the types of geometry that can
be added, and may return an error. Ownership of the passed geometry is taken by
the container rather than cloning as addGeometry() does.

For a polygon, hNewSubGeom must be a linearring. If the polygon is empty, the
first added subgeometry will be the exterior ring. The next ones will be the
interior rings.

### Parameters
* `geomcontainer`: existing geometry.
* `subgeom`: geometry to add to the existing geometry.

Remove a geometry from an exiting geometry container.

### Parameters
* `geom`: the existing geometry to delete from.
* `i`: the index of the geometry to delete. A value of -1 is a special flag
    meaning that all geometries should be removed.
* `todelete`: if TRUE the geometry will be destroyed, otherwise it will not.
    The default is TRUE as the existing geometry is considered to own the

"""
Set flag to enable/disable returning non-linear geometries in the C API.

This flag has only an effect on the OGR_F_GetGeometryRef(),
OGR_F_GetGeomFieldRef(), OGR_L_GetGeomType(), OGR_GFld_GetType() and
OGR_FD_GetGeomType() C API methods. It is meant as making it simple for
applications using the OGR C API not to have to deal with non-linear geometries,
even if such geometries might be returned by drivers. In which case, they will
be transformed into their closest linear geometry, by doing linear
approximation, with OGR_G_ForceTo().

Libraries should generally not use that method, since that could interfere with
other libraries or applications.

### Parameters
* `flag`: TRUE if non-linear geometries might be returned (default value).
          FALSE to ask for non-linear geometries to be approximated as linear
          geometries.

### Returns
a point or NULL.
