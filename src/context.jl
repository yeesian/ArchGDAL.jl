"""
    addfielddefn!(layer::AbstractFeatureLayer, name, etype::OGRFieldType; <keyword arguments>)

Create a new field on a layer.

This function should not be called while there are feature objects in existence
that were obtained or created with the previous layer definition.

Not all drivers support this function. You can query a layer to check if it
supports it with the OLCCreateField capability. Some drivers may only support
this method while there are still no features in the layer. When it is
supported, the existing features of the backing file/database should be updated
accordingly.

Drivers may or may not support not-null constraints. If they support creating
fields with not-null constraints, this is generally before creating any feature
to the layer.

### Parameters
* `layer`:  the layer to write the field definition.
* `name`:   name of the field definition to write to disk.
* `etype`:  type of the field definition to write to disk.

### Keyword arguments
* `nwidth`:     the preferred formatting width. 0 (default) indicates undefined.
* `nprecision`: number of decimals for formatting. 0 (default) for undefined.
* `justify`:    the formatting justification ([OJUndefined], OJLeft or OJRight)
* `approx`:     If `true` (default `false`), the field may be created in a
                slightly different form depending on the limitations of the
                format driver.
